# investoSim 📈

**investoSim** is a lightweight R package designed to help students, beginners, and educators understand the power of long-term investing through simple simulations and visualizations.

Rather than predicting the market, `investoSim` focuses on behavioral and time-based investing principles — like staying invested, starting early, and contributing consistently.
