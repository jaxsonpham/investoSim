Description: investoSim is a simple and educational R package designed to help users 
    understand the impact of foundational investing behaviors such as compounding, 
    consistent contributions, market timing, and delayed entry. The package provides 
    lightweight simulations and visualizations of key concepts like lump-sum vs. 
    dollar-cost averaging (DCA), the cost of missing the best days in the market, 
    and the long-term effects of waiting to invest. Ideal for students, educators, 
    or beginner investors seeking clarity, not complexity.
