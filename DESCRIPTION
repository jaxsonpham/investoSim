Description: investoSim is an educational R package that helps users understand 
    the impact of foundational investing behaviors such as compounding, 
    consistent contributions, market timing, and delayed entry. It provides 
    simple simulations and visualizations of key concepts like lump-sum vs. 
    dollar-cost averaging (DCA), the cost of missing the best market days, 
    and the long-term effects of starting early versus delaying. 
    Ideal for students, educators, or beginner investors seeking clarity, not complexity.
